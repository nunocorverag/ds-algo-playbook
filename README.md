# ðŸ“˜ Data Structures & Algorithms Playbook

This repository is my personal study guide for mastering **data structures and algorithms**, focusing on two main goals:

1. ðŸŽ¯ **Interview Preparation** â€“ mastering problem-solving patterns and core topics commonly asked in technical interviews (e.g. FAANG).
2. ðŸ§  **Competitive Programming** â€“ deep understanding of advanced algorithms and techniques used in platforms like Codeforces.

It contains concise notes, code implementations, and curated lists of problems for each topic.

## ðŸ§± Structure

Each topic has:

- A Markdown file with explanations
- A `/problems` folder for related problems and solutions
